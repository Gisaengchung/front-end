## What is FIIN?

FIIN stands for Film Indie. A site dedicated to empowering independent filmmakers and film industry professionals. In this application directors can submit a proposal to crowdfund a movie and then market and sell directly from our site. This empowers indie filmmakers by giving them complete control of their cinematic experience and rights. This site will also be a portal for industry film crews to connect and meet new actresses, cinemtographers or just regular movie goers.
