            Film Indepedent is a place for film industry professionals to network as well as find and support projects they may wish to be a part of. Additionally we want to bring about a platform that keeps a film crews vision and control in their own hands. We want to do this by providing a place for Independent film groups to crowd fund, market, sell and stream their movies. This gives film makers the opportunity to present and interact with their audience in a whole new format. Film makers can share director lead discussions, share their scripts, actively recruit actors and cinematographers. This is a place to allow for more accessibility and opportunity for independent film makers to succeed.
